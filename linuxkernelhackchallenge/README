./FAILED_profiling_lib
Contains a FAILED attempt of a profiling library that contains the required APIs
according to header file libprf.h

./FAILED_Linux_kernel_patch_attempt
Contains a FAILED attempt to change the Linux kernel scheduling - can be an
inspiration?
Uses a kernel module that must be installed to set up the interrupt handling.
L1 invalidation cache for powerPC used here.
Note: This is vital and must be used (powerPC e500v2) to be used by interrupt routine to 
invalidate L1 cache. 

./L1_invalidate_Kernel_module
Example of how to Invalidate L1 cache on a powerPC e500v2 architecture.
Note: This is vital and must be used (powerPC) to be used by interrupt routine 
to invalidate L1 cache. 

./testcase
Test case that may prove the correctness of achieved work. Corresponds to Full 
specification, Acceptance test 6. The principal characteristics of measured values 
for this test when working is found in Powerpoint picture in ./doc/

./doc
* Short version of Linux kernel hack challenge.
* Longer technical specification of task, including Acceptance tests that define 
  behaviour of profiling when working.
* PowerPoint picture of expected time usage behaviour for the test case as L1 cache
is invalidated at different points in time from execution start.
