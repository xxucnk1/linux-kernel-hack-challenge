Content of test case
=====================
Test case is found in time_a60hz.c
It calls sample functions that uses L1 cache to some extent over time.
The sequence of functions of different cache usage here
   Time_TypeP3,  Time_TypeP4,  Time_TypeP5
is created to achieve execution time behaviour according to picture in full specification.

The profiling usage in this template is started and ended using:
   START_PROFILING(Tint, Ttimeout)
   STOP_PROFILING(&Texe)

The functions (Time_TypeP3 etc.) for various cache usage are found in time_types.c

Main program in test_time_a60hz.c
